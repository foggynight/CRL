* API: rtb_log.h

** Introduction

Macros for printing to the stderr stream.

** Usage

For default behaviour: Include =rtb_log.h= in each compilation unit that is to
have access to the logging macros.

#+BEGIN_SRC C
#include "rtb_log.h"
#+END_SRC

Define the ~RTB_NO_EXIT~ macro before including =rtb_log.h= to prevent the
~elog~ macros from calling ~exit~.

#+BEGIN_SRC C
#define RTB_NO_EXIT
#include "rtb_log.h"
#+END_SRC
